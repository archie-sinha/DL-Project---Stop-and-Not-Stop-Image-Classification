# DL-Project---Stop-and-Not-Stop-Image-Classification
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based classifier to distinguish between images of stop signs and non-stop signs. Utilizing a combination of data augmentation, transfer learning, and clustering techniques, the project addresses the challenge of correctly identifying stop signs in diverse and complex real-world street scenes.
